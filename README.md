How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my program is functional and secure by utilizing the test cases I have coded. Each test case I used focused on a specific aspect of the Contact class. Essentially, my test cases ensured that each object within the Contact class was valid.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpres user needs by focusing on the information given to me and what limitations are in effect. For instance, certain objects in the Contact class only allowed a specific number of digits. I incorporated these needs into my program by ensuring that these objects would throw an error if an invalid amount of digits or invalid information was entered. I also utilized tests to ensure that the program only allowed what the user wants.

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I first figure out what exactly the user needs with the program. I then analyze what limitations need to be put in place for the program. Then, I decide how I want to incorporate the objects within the program based off of what the user is asking for. The key to this step is to ensure I am designing software that follows along with what the user wants in the program.
